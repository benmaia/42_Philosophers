Mutex &amp; Threads in C

This project is the famous dining philosophers problem.

In the mandatory, we have to use threads and mutex to avoid data races.
Here is a quick info:

	• One or more philosophers sit at a round table.
	There is a large bowl of spaghetti in the middle of the table.
	
	• The philosophers alternatively eat, think, or sleep.
	While they are eating, they are not thinking nor sleeping;
	while thinking, they are not eating nor sleeping;
	and, of course, while sleeping, they are not eating nor thinking.
	
	• There are also forks on the table. There are as many forks as philosophers.
	• Because serving and eating spaghetti with only one fork is very inconvenient, a philosopher takes their right and their left forks to eat, one in each hand.
	
	• When a philosopher has finished eating, they put their forks back on the table and start sleeping. Once awake, they start thinking again. The simulation stops when a philosopher dies of starvation.
	
	• Every philosopher needs to eat and should never starve.
	
	• Philosophers don’t speak with each other.
	
	• Philosophers don’t know if another philosopher is about to die.
	
	• No need to say that philosophers should avoid dying!
